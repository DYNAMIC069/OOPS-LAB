// Create a Base class that consists of private, protected and public data members and
// member functions. Try using different access modifiers for inheriting Base class to
// the Derived class and create a table that summarizes the above three modes (when
// derived in public, protected and private modes) and shows the access specifier of
// the members of base class in the Derived class.
