// Create a class called Student that contains the data members like age, name,
// enroll_no, marks. Create another class called Faculty that contains data members
// like facultyName, facultyCode, salary,deptt, age, experience, gender. Create the
// function display() in both the classes to display the respective information. The
// derived Class Person demonstrates multiple inheritance. The program should be
// able to call both the base classes and displays their information. Remove the
// ambiguity (When we have exactly same variables or same methods in both the base
// classes, which one will becalled?) by proper mechanism
