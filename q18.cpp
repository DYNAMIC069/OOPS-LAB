// You are given three classes A, B and C. All three classes implement their own
// version of func. In class A, func multiplies the value passed as a parameter by 2. In
// class B, func multiplies the value passed as a parameter by 3. In class C, func
// multiplies the value passed as a parameter by 5.You are given class D such that You
// need to modify the class D and implement the function update_val which sets D's
// val to new_val by manipulating the value by only calling the func defined in classes
// A, B and C.It is guaranteed that new_val has only 2, 3 and 5 as its prime factors.
// Implement class D's function update_val. This function should update D's val only
// by calling A, B and C's func.
// Sample Input
// new_val = 30
// Sample Output
// A's func called 1 times
// B's func called 1 times
// C's func called 1 times
